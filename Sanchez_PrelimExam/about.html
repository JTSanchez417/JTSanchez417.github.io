<img src="imgs\Profile_Picture.jpg" width="450" height="450">

<p>I am JOSEPH TROY L. SANCHEZ, and I am 20 years old and a college student at the University of the Immaculate
	Conception. I have a very vivid imagination to the point of wanting to create something like a piece of art or
	a story. I am a bit hot-headed and somewhat sensitive at times, but also a soft-hearted individual. My personal hobbies are drawing/doodling/sketching, Internet surfing, fiction writing, listening to music, and sometimes eating snacks if I have the time.
